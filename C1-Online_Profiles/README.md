### Resume
You will need to upload a .PDF of your resume to this repo, or connect with your mentor on an alternate way of submitting your resume.

> *Your GitHub repository is public* if you do not want to upload your resume to a public facing repository talk with your Mentor about an alternate way to submit this assignment.

I uploaded it to canvas instead of this repository.
